This repository contains my solution for the **[Anticipating Latency in Cloud Environments](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/anticipating-latency-in-cloud-environments)** Kaggle competition. The competition aimed to predict latency in cloud-native environments using machine learning models, with the evaluation metric being the **R¬≤ score**.  

## üèÜ Competition Objective  
The goal was to predict the latency for web server requests under various configurations and conditions in a cloud-native environment. Accurate predictions of latency are crucial for optimizing resource allocation and improving system performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Overview  

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were imputed using domain-specific techniques.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Generated new features, including interaction terms and aggregations, to capture critical patterns.  
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical features were encoded using target encoding for better predictive power.  

### 2. **Modeling**  
I experimented with various machine learning models:  
- **XGBoost**  
- **CatBoost**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Gradient Boosting**  

After tuning hyperparameters using **Optuna**, I achieved the best results with **CatBoostRegressor**.
